# ETL-Project

This was a project where we wanted to extract NBA data from 3 sources, transform the data to one final dataframe, and load the dataframe to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy. 

3 sources were used: 
  1. For traditional player stats: https://www.basketball-reference.com/
  2. fivethirtyEight.com for player ratings: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-ratings/
  3. NBA2K20 video game player ratings: https://nba2kw.com/list/nba-2k20-all-player-ratings/
